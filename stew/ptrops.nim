# Pointer operations and helpers - generally, dereferencing pointers that have
# been offset is unsafe and many of the operations herein have undefined
# and platform-specific behavior in corner cases.

# Due to poor codegen and subsequent lack of inlining, these operations
# are templates even where they could be func.

# Note that `ByteAddress` in stdlib is implemented as a signed integer and
# might lead to overflow on arithmetic - avoid
